  "readme": "# TailStream for node.js\n\nContinuously read from a growing file until stopped.\n\nThis is similar to other modules, however it requires an explicit `done()` signal before it stops checking and finally ends.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply replace the `fs.createReadStream()` call with `tailstream.createReadStream()`:\n\n    var tailstream = require('tailstream');\n    var r = tailstream.createReadStream(â€¦);\n\nNow consume it as a stand file `Readable` however you desire. Once you no longer have any interest in the file, call `done()` on it. This will trigger a final check before ending.\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install tailstream\n\n#License\n(BSD 2-Clause License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, Gil Pedersen &lt;gpdev@gpost.dk&gt;  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: \n\n1.
